# @abasb75/dicom-palettes

A comprehensive collection of 256-level color palettes/colormaps commonly used in medical imaging (DICOM), scientific visualization, and more.

Includes standard DICOM well-known palettes, vendor-specific palettes (GE, Siemens, etc.), and many popular colormaps from the scientific community.

This package provides a collection of 256-level color palettes/colormaps, derived from the following sources:

- **DICOM Standard (NEMA)**  
  Standard DICOM palettes (e.g., Hot Iron, PET, Hot Metal Blue, etc.) are directly extracted without modification from the official DICOM Standard.  
  Defined in Part 6, Annex B: Well-Known Color Palettes.

- **OHIF Viewers**  
  Some DICOM-related palettes were copied and resampled/interpolated to 256 levels from the OHIF implementation.
